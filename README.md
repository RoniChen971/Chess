# Chess
The software receives from the user two different types of tools and their locations on the chessboard
      By requesting from user the y coordinate and x coordinate of each tool and prints if one tool threatens the other tool
      if the user input digit less than zero or greater than 8 or two tools of the same type or the same position as both tools
      The program will print an error committee and end
